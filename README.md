    I am a passionate and dedicated frontend developer with a strong foundation built over two years of focused learning and practical experience. My journey began with a year-long immersive bootcamp at Faravin, where I honed my skills in modern frontend technologies and best practices. Following this, I have continued to deepen my expertise through self-learning and hands-on projects.

My core competencies include:

Proficiency in JavaScript and its libraries
Experience in creating dynamic and responsive web applications
Strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and web design principles
Ability to troubleshoot and solve complex coding issues
Commitment to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code
I am continuously exploring new tools and technologies to stay updated with industry trends and enhance my skill set. I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.
